                     The race towards dragging the competitors down and grabbing the spotlight has been on the rise.
                      Well! The competition of seeking client’s or viewer’s attention is quite fair.
                       After all, who doesn’t want to steal the show? But, transfixing the spectators on a particular business project.
                        Is it that easy?
